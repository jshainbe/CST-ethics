# Ethics of Data Analytics Github Assignment

# Passage

"a sober look at our world shows that the degree of human intervention, often in the service of business interests and consumerism, is actually making our earth less rich and beautiful, ever more limited and grey, even as technological advances and consumer goods continue to abound limitlessly. We seem to think that we can substitute an irreplaceable and irretrievable beauty with something which we have created ourselves."

# Analysis

1. There is no tangible good that is produced from numbers - 1s and 0s. 
2. Something that is natural created is a more meaningful and fulfilling experience a human can have. 
3. We ought to be cautious of humans taking control of too many things in our environment. Human touch is irreplaceable and even though we are attracted by technology, data and everything it provides we are also driven by emotions and feelings that these lack.
